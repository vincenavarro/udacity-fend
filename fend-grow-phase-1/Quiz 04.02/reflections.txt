You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I have been using HTML for some time, however I did learn about the new standards DOCTYPE and charset standards. When I started we didn't have such things :)
* Most of the syntax was only a refresher for me.
* Definitely keeping an eye out for detail. I am used to rebuilding pieces for print production (which is what I do) but I've not really done it for web.
* I've kept a much better eye on detail going forward!
